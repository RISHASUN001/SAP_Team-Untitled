=== EVALUATION EXAMPLES ===

GOOD MENTORING RESPONSE:
"I can hear how stressed you are about this mistake. That must feel overwhelming. Let's break this down step by step. First, can you tell me exactly what happened with the client requirements? Then we can figure out the best way to move forward and minimize the impact."

WHY IT'S GOOD:
- Validates emotions ("hear how stressed", "overwhelming")
- Offers structure ("step by step")
- Asks clarifying questions
- Focuses on solutions ("best way to move forward")
- Professional and supportive tone

POOR MENTORING RESPONSE:
"Yeah, whatever. Just fix it."

WHY IT'S POOR:
- Dismissive language
- No empathy
- No practical guidance
- Unprofessional tone
- Doesn't address the emotional distress

=== COMMON MENTORING MISTAKES TO WATCH FOR ===
1. Rushing to solutions without understanding the problem
2. Minimizing the mentee's emotional state
3. Giving advice without asking questions first
4. Being too directive instead of guiding
5. Focusing only on the technical problem, ignoring emotional impact
6. Using jargon or complex language when mentee is stressed
7. Making assumptions without clarifying
8. Not following up on emotional cues
